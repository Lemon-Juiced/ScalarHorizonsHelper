## Ore Generation
Ore Generation for the Scalar Horizons Modpack is primarily handled by 
[Useful Foundations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/useful-foundation) and 
[Useful Machinery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/useful-machinery).  
[Roots 4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roots) includes Silver Ore, but no way to disable it by default.
