# Scalar Horizons Helper
Helper Mod for the Scalar Horizons Modpack

## Ore Generation
Ore Generation for the Scalar Horizons Modpack is primarily handled by 
Useful Foundations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/useful-foundation) and 
[Useful Machinery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/useful-machinery).  
[Roots 4](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roots) includes Silver Ore, but no way to disable it by default.  
This mod overrides the Silver Ore generation from Roots 4 to have it drop the Raw Silver item from Useful Foundations.

## To Do
Handle Roots Silver related recipes, silk-touched ore should smelt to Useful Foundations Silver Ingot.
